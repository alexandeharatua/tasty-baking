# Tasty baking

## Project Overview
You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it. 
[The recipe source is located here.](http://go.udacity.com/android-baking-app-json)

## Why this Project
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.
